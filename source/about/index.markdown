Hey! I'm Adam and I'm a programmer that loves teaching people how to write code and sharing my knowledge. I enjoy conferences and local programming meetups as an attendee, speaker and organizer. I'm obsessed with clean code, but I never forget that the technology exists to serve its users. In my free time I play board games, drink craft beer or explore new cities without checking a map.

I love open source that's why I decided to join <a href="https://about.gitlab.com" target="_blank">GitLab</a>. Also, check out my gem <a href="https://github.com/adamniedzielski/tiddle" target="_blank">Tiddle</a> - Devise strategy for token authentication in API-only Ruby on Rails applications.
