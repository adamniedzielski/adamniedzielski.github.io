Hey! I'm Adam and I'm a Ruby / JavaScript programmer. During my career I worked
in a software house and run a consultancy. Then I transitioned to product work
and joined GitLab to be a full-time open source contributor. I like product
companies.

I worked remotely for two years, collaborating with people distributed across
(almost) all timezones. Now I'm back in an office. I live in Berlin, Germany.

In 2019 I took on the responsibility of managing other people. I'm happily
employed at [Liefery](https://engineering.liefery.com) as Team Lead.

I sometimes speak at conferences and local meetups. The most important past
events:
