Hey! I'm Adam and I'm a Ruby / JavaScript programmer. During my career I worked
in a software house and run a consultancy. Then I transitioned to product work
and joined GitLab to be a full-time open source contributor. I like product
companies.

I worked remotely for two years, collaborating with people distributed across
(almost) all timezones. Now I'm back in an office. I live in Berlin, Germany.

I'm happily employed at [Liefery](https://www.liefery.com) as Senior Backend
Developer.

I sometimes speak at conferences and local meetups. The most important past
events:

1. Brighton Ruby Conf 2017 - "Boring Ruby Code" -
